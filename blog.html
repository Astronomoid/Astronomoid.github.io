                        <p>Look around.<br>Behold.<br>Observe.<br>Analyse.<br>What do you see?</p>
                        <p>Of course, chaos, and everyone is struggling to survive, trying hard to earn more, and getting an unending list of better services. If this domain is restricted to humans only, that would not be just to other species. Not just we humans but every living entity on this planet is struggling to thrive. But what is the point of this survival when we do not even observe what we are doing and why we are doing all this?</p>
                        <p>Raising families, satisfying appetite, …<br>Is this the only goal we are born into this?<br>It seems so because we only see.<br>Start observing things, and you will see that there is far more to life than this routine survival. You will find that nature itself is not chaotic but has a very superior order. Everything which takes place anywhere is a part of that order. It is so perfectly woven that even things that started billions of years ago were so in order that led to what we are today. Even billions of years ago, if there were any tiny imperfections, we all would have been just gases and nothing.</p>
                        <p>We are so busy in our life that we never analyse nature, how perfect it is. <em>There must be a temperament of every individual, which should be analytical in nature and scientific as well.</em> So that everyone has the curiosity to see this astonishing nature. When we start analysing things, we will find a great order in this chaos.</p>
                        <p><u><em>We should not just focus on earning, raising and dying a meaningless life.</em></u> We should enjoy every part of it, not just manufactured pleasures.</p>
                        <p>I would just say start reading about our nature, how it works and how it plays. Start knowing things. Ask yourself why things happen. If you are not able to answer, seek your answer. Be critical, be analytical and be rational.</p>
                        <p>Why should only a Physicist know about stars, gravity, planets, galaxies …?<br>Why should only a Chemist know about matter, elements, reactions …?<br>Why should only a Biologist know what happens inside us? How we talk? Why we think?</p>
                        <p>And this list is truly unending. I am not asking to do a degree in all this but at least seek the knowledge of our nature, nature's nature, and whatnot. Take pleasure in knowing why we are? And I promise you that when you start analysing, you will find the <strong>nature is truly astonishing.</strong></p>

                        <p>Many things regarding one's profession, academic life, parents, finance, etc., continuously penetrate their cerebral domain, doing nothing at times but inhibiting the excellent sleep that they could have. Sometimes these things help them grow and move forward in their life but not always.</p>
                        <p>As Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam had said, <em>"Dreams are those which don't let you sleep."</em> Unfortunately, these are not dreams but reality haunting from behind in disguise of thoughts. I write this not to blabber about this dichotomy of mine. Instead, I wished to talk about following the "passion." Or, towards the end, I may go in the direction of being passionate.</p>
                        <p>"Follow your passion" is the most beautiful fallacy I have ever encountered. Really 7 billion + people and only a handful of things to choose from. And why do we go in one direction? Just because we can be good at that thing, but why do we need to be good at anything? Shan't we try as much as we can or live as much as we can?</p>
                        <p>"Follow your passion" exactly does the opposite. It restricts you in many ways. You stress, wander, fonder, and crumble in search of your passion. Some are fed from their infancy, so they consider that their passion. Micheal Jackson was so good at his thing, but was he content? Most of us keep searching for passion our entire lives and doing other things without being passionate about those things. Instead of searching for passions helplessly, one should be passionate about anything that comes the way. What is the harm in not being passionate about your 9-5 desk job? What is the harm in not being passionate about any of our professions? Even if we are not good at something, why can't we be passionate about that? Let's consider we have never played any musical instrument, but what is the harm in trying new instruments and listening to new music?</p>
                        <p>What if we have never played any game before, we can try now. Why do we need to be good at anything to that? Everything can't be a passion, and passion can't be the only thing in life. Seven billion people are there, and even if the most important person in this world is gone. 90% won't even know, and some who get to know might be happy after hearing that. If you are clicking on the keyboard, be passionate about that. If you are tutoring someone, be passionate about that. If you are cleaning your room, be passionate about that. Even if you are bathing, there is no harm in being passionate about that. Stop wasting your life searching for some socially constructed petty passions.</p>
                        <p><strong>Life is much more unique and beyond all these things. So be passionate about life and, of course, living it.</strong></p>
