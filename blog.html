</small>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-1 text-dark">Look around.<br> Behold.
                    <br> Observe.
                    <br> Analyse.
                    <br> What do you see?<br> Of course, chaos, and everyone is struggling to survive, trying hard to earn more, and getting an unending list of better services. If this domain is restricted to humans only, that would not be just to other
                    species. Not just we humans but every living entity on this planet is struggling to thrive. But what is the point of this survival when we do not even observe what we are doing and why we are doing all this?</p>
                <p class="mb-1 text-dark">Raising families, satisfying appetite, …<br> Is this the only goal we are born into this?<br> It seems so because we only see.<br> Start observing things, and you will see that there is far more to life than this routine survival. You
                    will find that nature itself is not chaotic but has a very superior order. Everything which takes place anywhere is a part of that order. It is so perfectly woven that even things that started billions of years ago were so in order
                    that led to what we are today. Even billions of years ago, if there were any tiny imperfections, we all would have been just gases and nothing. </p>
                <p class="mb-1 text-dark">We are so busy in our life that we never analyse nature, how perfect it is. <em>There must be a temperament
                    of every individual, which should be analytical in nature and scientific as well.</em> So that everyone has the curiosity to see this astonishing nature. When we start analysing things, we will find a great order in this chaos.<br>                    <u><em>We should
                    not just focus on earning, raising and dying a meaningless life.</em></u> We should enjoy every part of it, not just manufactured pleasures.</p>
                <p class="mb-1 text-dark"> I would just say start reading about our nature, how it works and how it plays. Start knowing things. Ask yourself why things happen. If you are not able to answer, seek your answer. Be critical, be analytical and be rational.<br> Why
                    should only a Physicist know about stars, gravity, planets, galaxies …?<br> Why should only a Chemist know about matter, elements, reactions …?<br> Why should only a Biologist know what happens inside us? How we talk? Why we think?<br>                    And this list is truly unending. I am not asking to do a degree in all this but at least seek the knowledge of our nature, nature's nature, and whatnot. Take pleasure in knowing why we are? And I promise you that when you start analysing,
                    you will find the <strong>nature is truly astonishing.</strong></p>
